# Web Development Internship

Welcome to my repository showcasing the completion of my web development internship at OctaNet. During this internship, I successfully completed three main tasks: creating a landing page, developing a todo list application, and cloning a webpage from the BCC website. Below, you'll find details about each task along with the corresponding code.

## Task 1: Landing Page

In this task, I designed and developed a captivating landing page to welcome users to the website. The landing page introduces the purpose of the website and provides easy navigation to other sections.

**Key Components:**
- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the landing page.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the landing page.
- Images and assets: Enhancing the visual appeal of the landing page.

## Task 2: Todo List Application

I created a dynamic to-do list application that allows users to add, manage, and complete tasks. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development and user interaction.

**Key Components:**
- `todo.html`: HTML structure for the todo list application.
- `todo.js`: JavaScript file for adding, removing, and marking tasks.
- `styles.css`: Styling rules specific to the to-do list application.

## Task 3: Website Clone (BCC)

For this task, I successfully cloned a webpage from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BCC) website. This involved replicating both the design and functionality of the original page.

**Key Components:**
- Multiple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files: Recreating the structure, styling, and interactions of the cloned BCC page.
- Images and assets: Replicating visual elements for an accurate representation.

## Usage Instructions

1. To view the landing page, open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Access the todo list application by opening `todo.html` in a web browser. Interact with tasks using the provided functionality.
3. Explore the cloned BCC webpage by opening `bcc_clone.html` in a web browser.
